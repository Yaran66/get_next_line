We encourage you to create test programs for your project even though this work
won’t have to be submitted and won’t be graded. It will give you a chance
to easily test your work and your peers’ work. You will find those tests especially
useful during your defence. Indeed, during defence, you are free to use your tests
and/or the tests of the peer you are evaluating.
